          <h1>BMI calculator</h1>
          <details>
              <summary>The most commonly tool for categorizing individuals based on their body mass and height.</summary>
              <p>Commonly accepted BMI ranges are underweight: under 18.5 kg/m2, normal weight: 18.5 to 25, overweight: 25 to 30, obese: over 30. The main shortcoming of the formula is the inability to accurately determine the ratio of body fat and muscle. Since muscle tissue is heavier than fatty tissue, individuals with a higher percentage of muscle tissue may be categorized as overweight.</p>

          <h1>Daily Calorie Needs Calculator</h1>
          <details>
            <summary>A method of estimating the daily calorie needs based on the Harris-Benedict formula.</summary>
            <p>The calculator uses the original Harris-Benedict formula and the revised version (by Mifflin and St Jeor) to calculate the basal metabolic rate of an individual. The result is then multiplied by a factor corresponding to the individual's activity level. This method has the same flaw as the BMI formula, it doesn't take into account the amount of body fat or muscle of an individual. The resulting calorie value is only adequate for individual that are overwieght or have normal weight. For obese individuals the result is usually reduced by 500-1000 kcal, and increased by the same amount for underweight individuals.</p>
